### Background
In Twitter, vast variety of people publicly post contents. Just as in real life, individuals communicate differently and can be differentiated by the differences in the works they create. This is an attempt to differnciate 3 Twitter accounts. The 3 different accounts that I have chosen for this purpose is 3 international footballers- Leonel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymer. They are well known for their great performance in football world and considered rivals. This reads at least 3000 tweets of each players and calculates lexical diversity, does sentimental analysis, calculates twitter ratio, analyzes the devices and client they used to tweet.

|            Messi           |             Ronaldo            |            Neymer            |

#### Lexical Diversity
Lexical diversity calculates how many different words that are used in the text.\s\s

    Green - Messi, Blue - Ronaldo, Red - Neymer
Lexical diversity = unique words/ total words. The more the lexical diversity is the more unique words have been used by the user. Y-axis is the lexical diversity in percentage for each tweets in X-axis.
