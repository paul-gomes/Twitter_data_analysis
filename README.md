### Background
In Twitter vast variety of people publicly post contents. Just as in real life, individuals communicate differently and can be differentiated by the differences in the works they create. This is an attempt to differnciate 3 Twitter accounts. The 3 different accounts that I have chosen for this purpose is 3 international footballers- Leonel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymer. They are well known for their great performance in football world and considered rivals. This reads at least 3000 tweets of each players and calculates lexical diversity, does sentimental analysis, calculates twitter ratio, analyzes the devices and client they used to tweet.
